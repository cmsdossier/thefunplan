										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Madrid, as missed as it is hated by its inhabitants, is a destination that is always a pleasure to visit. If you are passing through and you only have one day to see it, we recommend the essential sites that will leave you with good memories of the capital and, of course, will invite you to return.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">In the morning</h3>



<p>What better than Kilometer Zero in the capital to start the day?&nbsp;<strong>The door of the sun&nbsp;</strong>It will become the first obligatory place. A New Year&#039;s Eve witness and center of demonstrations, it will not bore you or leave you indifferent. There you will see the chiming clock, the Tío Pepe sign, you will enjoy the music of the street artists and you will be able to take a photo of the symbol of Madrid, the bear and the strawberry tree.</p>



<p>Take the main street and walk along it to find the royal symbols of the capital,&nbsp;<strong>The Royal Theater, the Almudena Cathedral and the Royal Palace</strong>&nbsp;with its infinite gardens. If you feel like walking a little further, you are very close to Las Vistillas, where the best festivals in Madrid are celebrated every May and August in honor of its patron saint, San Isidro. If you cross the Segovia bridge you will reach the park&nbsp;<strong>Madrid Rio</strong>&nbsp;where the Manzanares crosses, full of people on weekends. If the weather is good, I recommend a walk to the&nbsp;<strong>Cottage</strong>&nbsp;to be amazed at the number of people who practice sports in Madrid.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Eat in Madrid</h3>



<p>You will surely get hungry so I recommend you return to the&nbsp;<strong>Main Square</strong>&nbsp;and eat a good calamari sandwich to regain strength in one of the many bars around the square. Here you have the best places. If what you like is wines, you can take a walk through Latina and have tapas in the different taverns, in this guide you will find the best ones. And if you prefer to eat in restaurants, here we leave you the best options for all tastes!</p>



<p>To wash down the meal, start the afternoon with a walk through the&nbsp;<strong>Alcala Street</strong>&nbsp;where you will meet the Madrid goddess, Cibeles, and the Gate that inspired Ana Belén and Víctor Manuel: The&nbsp;<strong>Alcalá Gate</strong>. We leave you the From there stop to rest in the Green Lung of Madrid, the&nbsp;<strong>Retirement park</strong>. You can&#039;t leave without renting a boat on the lake, feeding the ducks and going to the Crystal Palace.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">In the afternoon</h3>



<p>As you will have regained your strength, I recommend you go to the Paseo del Prado and visit one of the museums in Madrid. He&nbsp;<strong>Prado Museum</strong>&nbsp;It is the most visited tourist attraction after the Santiago Bernabeu, but you can also go to the Thyssen, Caixafórum or Reina Sofía, near Atocha, and on the way you will find the venue for the Atlético team, the Neptune fountain.</p>



<p>As evening falls, approach&nbsp;<strong>The Gran Via</strong>&nbsp;to explore the most emblematic street in the city. Look at the Sweepes poster, a symbol of so many films, at its tall buildings and at the number of musicals, Madrid&#039;s Broadway. Get to Plaza de España and from there say goodbye to the day contemplating the sunset from the&nbsp;<strong>Temple of Debod</strong>, a gift from Egypt, which will give you one of the best views of the city.</p>



<p>Although if you don&#039;t want to go that far, you can also watch the sunset from the rooftop of the&nbsp;<strong>Circle of Fine Arts</strong>&nbsp;from where you will have a view like the cover photo, words are unnecessary.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The night in Madrid</h3>



<p>Nightlife in Madrid has many faces and many options for tastes. If what you like are culinary experiences, we recommend you visit the most multicultural neighborhood in Madrid,&nbsp;<strong>Lavapiés</strong>, and choose from its many world food options: Indian, Pakistani, African...</p>



<p>If you prefer something more select and chic, you can dine at a restaurant in the neighborhood of&nbsp;<strong>Grandstand</strong>ly&nbsp;<strong>Chueca</strong>, from where you can then have one, or several drinks in its bars. You will find the coolest party in the neighborhood of&nbsp;<strong>Orchards</strong>, where you will surely make friends with more than one French or English Erasmus student, and to end the most Madrid-like night you should end up dancing sevillanas at the Candela flamenco tablao.</p>



<p>But Madrid also has many more options to offer. Here we leave you&nbsp;<a href="/en/journey/" data-type="page" data-id="815">the funniest plans</a>&nbsp;and, if you want to spend the night in the capital,&nbsp;<strong>all hotels in Madrid</strong>&nbsp;the best price. No matter where you spend the night, before leaving you should have a chocolate and churros for breakfast that will take away any hangover, at the chocolate shop.&nbsp;<strong>San Ginés.</strong></p>



<p>Enjoy it!</p>]]></content:encoded>
