<p>Of course, the ultimate disco giant could not be absent from the islands. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/nbJTGrATTK/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.instagram.com/p/nbJTGrATTK/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pacha Gran Canaria</a> attracts a full house every weekend. When it comes to parties, no matter which city you visit, you can always count on finding a venue that belongs to this king of nightlife.</p>



<p>Without a doubt, it is a safe bet. The room offers two different environments and a terrace with comfortable armchairs, providing a refreshing space to relax between dances.</p>



<p>Additionally, it offers the option of being taken to the venue in a limousine, although it is important to note that the responsibility for the return trip falls on each individual.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/terrazakopalaspalmas/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.instagram.com/terrazakopalaspalmas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Kopa terrace</a> is a large open-air nightclub located in Santa Catalina, one of the most famous and vibrant areas of the island.</p>



<p>Prices are quite reasonable, and there are numerous bars spread throughout the place, ensuring that ordering a drink doesn&#039;t become an ordeal.</p>



<p>As for music, there is something for everyone&#039;s taste. Therefore, if you don&#039;t like a song, there is no need to worry because the next one will surely be more to your liking. 😉</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Ozone Club</h2>



<p>Playa del Inglés (Maspalomas)</p>



<p>For those who want to extend the party until the wee hours of the morning, Club Ozono is the perfect choice. Not only is it one of the most popular nightclubs on the island, but it also stays open until 7am!</p>



<p>Every night, the room is transformed into a temple of techno music, animated by numerous well-known DJs. And if you&#039;re looking for a break from the energetic beats, they also have several rooms with more relaxed music where you can relax with a few drinks before returning to the dance floor with renewed energy.</p>



<p>¿Serás capaz de esperar hasta que cuelguen el cartel de &#8220;cerrado&#8221;?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Album La Divina</h2>



<p>Olof Palme Street (Las Palmas)</p>



<p>Are you looking to enjoy drinks at a reasonable price? It may sound incredible, but it is really possible. However, when visiting this <a href="https://disco-la-divina.negocio.site/" data-type="link" data-id="https://disco-la-divina.negocio.site/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pub in Las Palmas</a>, it is important to exercise caution. With the multitude of offerings they have, it&#039;s quite easy to end up overdoing it with one or many more drinks.</p>



<p>Plus, if you get hungry or fancy a snack, they also offer burgers and other delicacies. And the best part? All this is accompanied by the rhythmic beats of music!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Kasbah Shopping Center</h2>

<p>This shopping center serves as a nighttime meeting point for both tourists and locals. It has several pubs and clubs, each offering a unique style of music, allowing you to choose the perfect place to dance the night away.</p>



<p>I recommend visiting <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100063777300816" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100063777300816" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Mojito pub</a>, which is always packed and frequently hosts themed parties every weekend. If you enjoy good salsa, Friday is the perfect day for you!</p>]]></content:encoded>
