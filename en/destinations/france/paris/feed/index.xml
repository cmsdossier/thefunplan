										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Easter holidays are approaching, some will enjoy a few days off in the first week of May and the summer months are &#039;just around the corner&#039;. If you are planning a getaway and don&#039;t know where to go, we recommend a safe bet: Paris. The capital of France, in addition to being <strong>one of the most touristic cities in the world</strong>, it is perfect to visit in a couple of days. If you want to surprise your partner in the &#039;city of love&#039; or enjoy with your family in a town whose leisure options are endless, we explain what to do in your <a href="/en/journey/" data-type="page" data-id="815">trip to paris</a> in two days.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">ARRIVAL TO THE CAPITAL</h2>



<p>Thanks to low-cost flights, it is increasingly&nbsp;<strong>easy and economical to travel to the French capital</strong>; and whatever airport you land at, you can access the heart of Paris by transport. We recommend that you book your accommodation in the most central neighborhoods or close to the main metro stops, since these days we will be moving around the city by this means of transport. Once you leave your suitcases in your room, head to the Trocadero stop. As soon as you exit the metro you will have a beautiful image of the quintessential symbol of Paris:&nbsp;<strong>the Eiffel Tower</strong>.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img  fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="550" height="828"  src="https://thefunplan.b-cdn.net/uploads/2023/10/Torre-Eiffel.jpg"  alt="Eiffel Tower Paris" class="wp-image-2590" srcset="https://thefunplan.b-cdn.net/uploads/2023/10/Torre-Eiffel.jpg 550w, https://thefunplan.b-cdn.net/uploads/2023/10/Torre-Eiffel-199x300.jpg 199w, https://thefunplan.b-cdn.net/uploads/2023/10/Torre-Eiffel-8x12.jpg 8w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Eiffel Tower, Paris</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>After taking the first photographs of your trip, go to the foot of the base to&nbsp;<strong>climb to this famous viewpoint</strong>. If you want to ascend on foot you will have to go to the ticket office on the right, while if you want to take the elevator go to the one on the left. You have three different heights, but we definitely recommend that you go to the highest. The entrance price ranges from 5 to 14 euros and the tower remains open until midnight, so you can enjoy the wonderful views of Paris for as long as you want.</p>



<p>From there, we will walk to another of the city&#039;s symbols, the<strong>&nbsp;Arch of Triumph</strong>; and if it is before 11 p.m. and we want to go up, we can do so by paying an entrance fee of 9.50 euros. From above you have impressive views of one of the main arteries of the capital, the Champs Elysées. Before going to our accommodation to rest, we will walk along the famous avenue looking at the elegant windows of the most glamorous stores in the city.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">FIRST DAY</h2>



<p>We will start at the third symbol of the city, the&nbsp;<strong>Notre Dame Cathedral</strong>, and we will be on the left side of the religious temple around 9:30 am. And starting at 10 a.m. you can climb to the top of the towers from where you will have magnificent views of the center of Paris and you can photograph the friendly gargoyles that accompany the entire route. Once down, don&#039;t forget to enter the interior of Notre Dame since access is free, unlike the climb to the towers which costs 8.50 euros.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img  decoding="async" width="550" height="573"  src="https://thefunplan.b-cdn.net/uploads/2023/10/Notre-Dame.jpg"  alt="Cathedrale Notre-Dame - Paris" class="wp-image-2591" srcset="https://thefunplan.b-cdn.net/uploads/2023/10/Notre-Dame.jpg 550w, https://thefunplan.b-cdn.net/uploads/2023/10/Notre-Dame-288x300.jpg 288w, https://thefunplan.b-cdn.net/uploads/2023/10/Notre-Dame-12x12.jpg 12w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Cathedrale Notre-Dame – Paris</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>From there we will go to the most visited museum in the world, the&nbsp;<strong>Louvre</strong>, although first we will pass through two of the beautiful bridges that cross the waters of the Seine River: the&nbsp;<strong>New Bridge and the Bridge of Arts</strong>. The latter is &#039;invaded&#039; by millions of padlocks placed by couples in love who want to seal their love with this romantic gesture. After photographing the exterior of the Louvre, we will walk through the<strong>&nbsp;Tuileries Gardens</strong>&nbsp;and we will end up in the center&nbsp;<strong>Concorde Square</strong>. Very close to her is the&nbsp;<strong>Madeleine church</strong>, one of the few free monuments in Paris; and from there we will walk towards the north of the city to see the&nbsp;<strong>Garnier opera</strong>&nbsp;whose entrance costs 9 euros per person.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img  decoding="async" width="550" height="370"  src="https://thefunplan.b-cdn.net/uploads/2023/10/opera-garnier.jpg"  alt="Opera Garnier Paris" class="wp-image-2592" srcset="https://thefunplan.b-cdn.net/uploads/2023/10/opera-garnier.jpg 550w, https://thefunplan.b-cdn.net/uploads/2023/10/opera-garnier-300x202.jpg 300w, https://thefunplan.b-cdn.net/uploads/2023/10/opera-garnier-18x12.jpg 18w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Opera Garnier Paris</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Our next stop is&nbsp;<strong>Basilica of the Sacred Heart</strong>n, and to do this, we will go through the famous&nbsp;<strong>Galeries Lafayette</strong>, the legendary cabaret&nbsp;<strong>Moulin Rouge</strong>&nbsp;and we will climb the endless stairs of the&nbsp;<strong>Montmartre neighborhood</strong>. Admission to the interior of the Sacred Heart is free, and from the outside, you have impressive views of the immense Paris. If we still have the strength, we take a subway to the&nbsp;<strong>Pantheon</strong>&nbsp;since it remains open until 6 p.m. and the entrance price is 7.50 euros.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img  loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="550" height="413"  src="https://thefunplan.b-cdn.net/uploads/2023/10/galerias-lafayette.jpg"  alt="Galeries Lafayette - Paris" class="wp-image-2593" srcset="https://thefunplan.b-cdn.net/uploads/2023/10/galerias-lafayette.jpg 550w, https://thefunplan.b-cdn.net/uploads/2023/10/galerias-lafayette-300x225.jpg 300w, https://thefunplan.b-cdn.net/uploads/2023/10/galerias-lafayette-16x12.jpg 16w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Galeries Lafayette – Paris</figcaption></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">SECOND DAY</h2>



<p>Depending on the time our flight leaves, we can do more or less things in the last hours of our trip. We recommend that you do not leave the capital without making a&nbsp;<strong>Batobus ride along the Seine</strong>; They are boats that travel from the water to the main monuments of the city. And three monuments that we can find precisely on the banks of the river are the&nbsp;<strong>&#039;Small&#039; and &#039;Big&#039; Palace</strong>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<strong>Invalides monument</strong>; The entrance price for the latter is 9 euros while access to the palaces is free. If we want to see something else, there are numerous museums that are worth visiting, although after the Louvre we highlight the&nbsp;<strong>Orsay&#039;s Museum</strong>&nbsp;as the most appropriate option.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img  loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="550" height="276"  src="https://thefunplan.b-cdn.net/uploads/2023/10/Museo-Orsay.jpg"  alt="Orsay Museum - Paris" class="wp-image-2595" srcset="https://thefunplan.b-cdn.net/uploads/2023/10/Museo-Orsay.jpg 550w, https://thefunplan.b-cdn.net/uploads/2023/10/Museo-Orsay-300x151.jpg 300w, https://thefunplan.b-cdn.net/uploads/2023/10/Museo-Orsay-18x9.jpg 18w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Orsay Museum - Paris</figcaption></figure></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The city of love, art and culture. Paris is the dream destination for bohemians and artists who look for their creative inspiration in its streets. More than 900 films have been filmed there, some of which have become classics of romantic cinema. It is a sure success if we are thinking of organizing a&nbsp;<a href="/en/journey/" target="_blank" data-type="page" data-id="815" rel="noreferrer noopener">trip to paris</a>&nbsp;You want to know why? This city has one of the greatest cultural and leisure offerings in all of Europe. Unfortunately, lack of time often does not allow us to enjoy the French capital for more than a few hours but, although it may seem incredible, it is possible to contemplate its charm and beauty in just one day of visiting.</p>



<p>The city is divided into 20 districts with several unique and different areas in themselves thanks to the personality of its inhabitants. The essential thing as soon as you land in Paris is to get a map of the city as it will be the best way to not get lost in the labyrinth of streets that make it up. The Paris metro will also be your best ally to move around and cross the distances that separate its districts. However, you will see how there are ways to enjoy Paris also on your own with walks that will not leave you indifferent. There we go to discover&nbsp;<strong>Paris in one day</strong>!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">In the morning</h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Buy your tickets and visit the museums and shows in Paris without lines!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The first stop will be, without a doubt,&nbsp;<strong>its most precious monument: The Eiffel Tower</strong>. You only get the feeling of living Paris when you leave the metro and find yourself in front of it. You can contemplate a&nbsp;<strong>complete panoramic walk through the Trocadero gardens that surround it and through the Champ de Mars park</strong>. Lie down on the grass and enjoy the pleasure of being in Paris. If you want to climb the Eiffel Tower, I recommend doing it first thing in the morning, although we will see other places from where there are even better views of the city.</p>



<p><strong>Approach the bank of the Siena River that separates the city and walk to the Louvre Museum</strong>, unique in itself and housing some of the best works of the impressionist masters and the unique work of&nbsp;<strong>“The Mona Lisa” by Leonardo Da Vinci</strong>. Make sure your visit does not fall on a Tuesday as it is the only day the museum is closed. If you are lucky enough to be young university students between 18 and 25 years old, the visit will be free. If you have time in the morning, I advise you to take advantage and also visit the Notre Dame Cathedral, buy some of the works of the artists who gather at the market on the banks of the Siena and contemplate the view from one of its bridges.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">In the afternoon</h2>



<p>Paris, although beautiful, is a city suitable only for the most select pockets. However, we must not miss enjoying some of its greatest pleasures:&nbsp;<strong>a cappuccino accompanied by a crepe in one of the Parisian cafes in the Montmartre neighborhood</strong>. Start the afternoon in this neighborhood and go up to the Basilica of the Sacred Heart (Sacre-Coeur) from where you will have a magnificent panoramic view of the city sitting at the top of the stairs while listening to some street musician who will liven up your day like those of the following video.</p>



<p>As the sun goes down, I recommend taking the subway to contemplate the&nbsp;<strong>Arc de Triomphe and stroll along the Champs Elysées</strong>&nbsp;until you reach the roof of the Georges Pompidou National Center for Art and Culture from where you can enjoy&nbsp;<strong>the best view of Paris totally free with the sunset</strong>: contemplating from the Eiffel Tower, passing by Notre-Dame to Sacre-Coeur.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">per night</h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Shows and museums without lines. Buy your tickets and enjoy the city of love at 100%!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If you want to enjoy the Parisian night you can come to&nbsp;<strong>enjoy the Cabaret show of the famous Moulin Rouge</strong>, although for this you will have to pay for a dinner that is around 200 euros. However, if your pocket cannot afford such an outlay, I recommend looking at some other cabaret or contemplating the Champs Elysées illuminated at night again until you reach the Eiffel Tower seen from the Trocadero gardens, a&nbsp;<strong>experience that you will not forget</strong>.</p>



<p>Have you thought about combining your trip to Paris with another of the European cultural cities? You can try one of our options&nbsp;<a href="/en/journey/" data-type="page" data-id="815" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">group trip</a>, will not leave you indifferent.</p>]]></content:encoded>
