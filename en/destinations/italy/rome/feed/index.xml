Y tras estar tres días allí, puedo decir que he vuelto más enamorada todavía si cabe que antes de viajar. Pasear por calles donde dos mil años...]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had read so much and seen so many photographs of Rome, that I thought that when I was finally in the capital of Italy nothing about the city would surprise me. And after spending three days there, I can say that I have returned even more in love, if possible, than before traveling. </p>



<p>Walking through streets where Julius Caesar walked two thousand years ago, seeing monuments as ancient as the Pantheon or the Colosseum or others as beautiful and majestic as the Trevi Fountain, and being able to visit one of the smallest states in the world on foot is only possible in a corner of the planet: Rome. I invite you to find out what my trip to the Eternal City has been like in 3 days.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">THE VATICAN</h2>



<p>When I thought about which area of the city to stay in, I chose to rent an apartment in Rome near the Vatican since it is close to two metro stops (Cipro and Ottaviano), you can walk to the city center (about 25 minutes at a brisk pace) and found the prices to be much cheaper. </p>



<p>This gave me the opportunity to get to know the Vatican in depth, a state that had always caught my attention due to its peculiar geographical and administrative location. Only very high stone walls delimit the border between the streets of Rome and the interior of the famous &#039;<strong>smallest country in the world</strong>&#039;. Precisely on my first day in the city I decided to get to know the Vatican in depth.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img  fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="640" height="463"  src="https://thefunplan.b-cdn.net/uploads/2023/10/St.-Peters-Basilica-rome-italy.jpg"  alt="The Vatican" class="wp-image-2630" srcset="https://thefunplan.b-cdn.net/uploads/2023/10/St.-Peters-Basilica-rome-italy.jpg 640w, https://thefunplan.b-cdn.net/uploads/2023/10/St.-Peters-Basilica-rome-italy-300x217.jpg 300w, https://thefunplan.b-cdn.net/uploads/2023/10/St.-Peters-Basilica-rome-italy-18x12.jpg 18w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The Vatican</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>We start by placing ourselves in the row of the&nbsp;<strong>Vatican Museums</strong>, where it seems like the world is going to end due to the large number of people there; not only tourists, but guides who offer their &#039;desperate&#039; services to visitors who are within 20 meters of the entrance to the museums. </p>



<p>What do you get if you choose to enter with a guide? Direct access without waiting inside, but the price per person is much higher than standing in the &#039;rigorous line&#039; and waiting your turn. If you have an international student card (the typical youth card that we use in Spain does not work) you can enter by paying 8 euros, otherwise you will have to purchase your ticket for 16 euros per person.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>The interior of the Vatican Museums is made up of numerous exhibitions, each one with a different theme such as paintings, tapestries, sculptures, numismatics...</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>A piece of advice: if you want to escape the large crowds, start with the museums on the right, they are always much less crowded than those next to the&nbsp;<strong>Sistine Chapel</strong>. And it is precisely this last one that is the most coveted room by tourists who visit the Vatican Museums. </p>



<p>Of course, to access it you must cover your shoulders and knees, remain silent and not take photographs (even without a flash). From there there is a door, quite hidden, that directly connects the Chapel with the interior of the&nbsp;<strong>basilica of Saint Peter</strong>.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img  decoding="async" width="640" height="383"  src="https://thefunplan.b-cdn.net/uploads/2023/10/Philosophy-School-Of-Athens-rome-italy.jpg"  alt="Sistine Chapel" class="wp-image-2629" srcset="https://thefunplan.b-cdn.net/uploads/2023/10/Philosophy-School-Of-Athens-rome-italy.jpg 640w, https://thefunplan.b-cdn.net/uploads/2023/10/Philosophy-School-Of-Athens-rome-italy-300x180.jpg 300w, https://thefunplan.b-cdn.net/uploads/2023/10/Philosophy-School-Of-Athens-rome-italy-18x12.jpg 18w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Sistine Chapel</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>San Pedro is the largest church in the world and without a doubt surprises everyone who visits it. Even if you do not access its interior from the Vatican Museums, entry has no cost. </p>



<p>However, going up to the dome costs about 9 euros per person and from the top you can have stunning views of the enormous&nbsp;<strong>St. Peter&#039;s Square</strong>, one of the largest on the planet. To go up to the dome you cannot avoid climbing stairs, so although there is a part that you can avoid taking the elevator, then you have to ascend a spiral staircase to the top of the basilica.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">HEART OF THE CAPITAL</h2>



<p>The second day of my stay was based on getting to know the main monuments of Rome in depth, which, as happens if&nbsp;<a href="/en/paris-in-two-days/" target="_blank" data-type="link" data-id="/paris-en-dos-dias/" rel="noreferrer noopener">you travel to paris</a>, most points of interest are in the center and you can explore them perfectly on foot. </p>



<p>The first stop was very close to the Vatican, on the banks of the Tiber River, where the spectacular&nbsp;<strong>Castle of Sant Angelo</strong>&nbsp;which I did not enter due to lack of time and a somewhat limited budget (and the entrance cost 9 euros per person). From there we reach the&nbsp;<strong>Navona Square</strong>, where despite being one of the largest in Rome, it was completely overwhelmed by tourists spread across its three main points: the<strong>&nbsp;Fountains of Neptune, Moro and the Three Rivers</strong>.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img  decoding="async" width="640" height="480"  src="https://thefunplan.b-cdn.net/uploads/2023/10/Campo-de-Fiori-Rome-Italy.jpg"  alt="Campo dei Fiori" class="wp-image-2628" srcset="https://thefunplan.b-cdn.net/uploads/2023/10/Campo-de-Fiori-Rome-Italy.jpg 640w, https://thefunplan.b-cdn.net/uploads/2023/10/Campo-de-Fiori-Rome-Italy-300x225.jpg 300w, https://thefunplan.b-cdn.net/uploads/2023/10/Campo-de-Fiori-Rome-Italy-16x12.jpg 16w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Campo dei Fiori</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The next stop was at the&nbsp;<strong>Campo dei Fiori</strong>&nbsp;where in a small space they had set up a large street market where they sold, at quite high prices, pasta, fruit, vegetables, liquors and flowers. </p>



<p>We head to one of the most beautiful monuments that is sometimes not given as much importance as the famous Colosseum:&nbsp;<strong>Agrippa&#039;s Pantheon</strong>. It is one of the oldest heritage sites in Italy and access to the interior is completely free. In addition, there are numerous ice cream parlors nearby to taste this delicious Italian product. </p>



<p>A 5-minute walk from there, I reached the&nbsp;<strong>Trevi Fountain</strong>&nbsp;where to my surprise it was fenced off due to construction (something common in Rome...). To continue the tour through the city center, I passed through the&nbsp;<strong>Colonna Square</strong>, I climbed the long staircase&nbsp;<strong>Spain Square</strong>&nbsp;and I came to&nbsp;<strong>Villa Borguese</strong>&nbsp;crossing the&nbsp;<strong>Popolo Square</strong>. An intense day, but where I was able to see the main monuments of Rome.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img  loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="385"  src="https://thefunplan.b-cdn.net/uploads/2023/10/latin-writings-in-front-of-Pantheon-in-Rome-Italy.jpg"  alt="Pantheon of Agrippa" class="wp-image-2627" srcset="https://thefunplan.b-cdn.net/uploads/2023/10/latin-writings-in-front-of-Pantheon-in-Rome-Italy.jpg 640w, https://thefunplan.b-cdn.net/uploads/2023/10/latin-writings-in-front-of-Pantheon-in-Rome-Italy-300x180.jpg 300w, https://thefunplan.b-cdn.net/uploads/2023/10/latin-writings-in-front-of-Pantheon-in-Rome-Italy-18x12.jpg 18w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Pantheon of Agrippa</figcaption></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">COLISEUM AND THE HILLS OF ROME</h2>



<p>At 12 noon on my third day in Rome I was in the&nbsp;<strong>Gianicolo hill</strong>, where in addition to having beautiful views of the city, one of the shows takes place: the firing of a cannon. </p>



<p>So like every day, a van arrived with several soldiers and under the statue of Garibaldi they opened a door and took out a cannon; They loaded it and after counting down they &#039;deafened&#039; the few attendees who were present. After this curious act that has been taking place for more than a hundred years, we walked to the &#039;neighboring&#039; neighborhood of&nbsp;<strong>Trastevere</strong>.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>Trastevere: Its picturesque and narrow cobbled streets are full of restaurants where it is inevitable not to want to try their pizzas and pastas...</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>But the last stop of our trip was the Colosseum, so we headed there but not before going to see the famous&nbsp;<strong>Mouth of Truth</strong>.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-full"><img  loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="480" height="640"  src="https://thefunplan.b-cdn.net/uploads/2023/10/Mouth-of-Truth-Colosseum.jpg"  alt="Mouth of Truth in Rome" class="wp-image-2625" srcset="https://thefunplan.b-cdn.net/uploads/2023/10/Mouth-of-Truth-Colosseum.jpg 480w, https://thefunplan.b-cdn.net/uploads/2023/10/Mouth-of-Truth-Colosseum-225x300.jpg 225w, https://thefunplan.b-cdn.net/uploads/2023/10/Mouth-of-Truth-Colosseum-9x12.jpg 9w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Mouth of Truth in Rome</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Nearby is one of the most impressive monuments in Rome: the&nbsp;<strong>Monument to Victor Emmanuel II</strong>; Access to its interior is free of charge, there are free toilets and Wi-Fi connection. From there we went directly to the entrance of the Roman Forum to buy the ticket that gave us access to the&nbsp;<strong>Forum, the Palatine and the Colosseum</strong>. Why buy it at the Forum and not at the Colosseum? Because the lines are about 20 times shorter in the Forum, the price is the same and the only thing that changes is that the first thing you see is the Palatine and the Roman Forum…</p>



<p>The three places are true gems of history and the only drawback is that the mass tourism and the heat made me desperate at times. However, the reward was worth it since being able to explore on foot three corners that are more than two thousand years old is a true marvel. The price? For those under 25 years of age it is 7.50 euros and for the rest it is 12 euros; something much more than considerable considering the cultural value of all of them.</p>]]></content:encoded>

</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Colosseum opening hours</h2>



<p>Plan your visit to the Colosseum knowing the exact opening hours. When it comes to exploring this iconic ancient Roman amphitheater, timing is everything. During peak tourist season, the Colosseum can be incredibly crowded, which can detract from your experience.</p>



<p>To make the most of your visit, it&#039;s crucial to choose the best time to go. The Colosseum opens at 8:30 am and closes one hour before sunset. Arriving early in the morning or later in the afternoon can help you avoid the large crowds, allowing you to enjoy the grandeur of this architectural wonder without feeling overwhelmed.</p>



<p>Additionally, the lighting during these moments creates a magical atmosphere, enhancing the beauty of the structure. So, plan your visit accordingly and make the most of your time at the Colosseum.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">High tourist season</h2>



<p>Are you ready to plan your visit to the Colosseum?</p>



<p>Well, before you go, it&#039;s important to know the peak tourist season to avoid the crowds and make the most of your experience. The Colosseum attracts millions of visitors each year, so it&#039;s best to avoid the summer months of June, July and August, when the crowds are at their peak.</p>



<p>Instead, consider visiting in the transition months of April, May, September and October for a more pleasant and less crowded experience.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Busy times to avoid.</h3>



<p>To avoid crowds during peak tourist season at the Colosseum, plan your visit outside of busy times.</p>



<p>The Colosseum attracts millions of visitors each year, especially during the summer and holiday months. If you want to experience the ancient amphitheater without feeling like a sardine in a can, it&#039;s crucial to plan strategically and avoid rush hour.</p>



<p>The best time to visit is early morning or late afternoon, when most tourists are still enjoying their breakfast or dinner. Weekdays, especially Mondays and Wednesdays, tend to be less crowded than weekends.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Best months to visit.</h3>



<p>The best months to visit the Colosseum during peak tourist season are June through August. This is the time when the weather is at its best, making it the ideal time to explore this magnificent ancient wonder. Here we explain why you should plan your trip during these months:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">

<p>The off-peak tourist season is the perfect time to plan your trip. During this time, usually in the fall and winter months, the number of visitors is significantly lower, allowing you to explore the iconic location without the hustle and bustle of the high season.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Best time to visit</h3>



<p>When visiting the Colosseum, the best time to go is during the low tourist season. Here&#039;s why:</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Avoiding crowds</h3>



<p>To avoid crowds during your visit to the Colosseum, opt for the off-season tourist season. This is the perfect time to experience the ancient wonder without the hassle of long lines and crowds.</p>



<p>The off-season generally occurs between November and February, when the number of tourists is significantly lower. With fewer people around, you&#039;ll have the freedom to explore the Colosseum at your own pace and truly appreciate its grandeur.</p>



<p>To make the most of your visit, consider purchasing timed entry tickets. These tickets allow you to skip the lines and enter the Colosseum at a specific time, ensuring a smoother and more efficient experience.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Morning visits</h2>



<p>Start your day right with a morning visit to the Colosseum. As the sun begins to rise, the ancient walls of this iconic structure are bathed in a golden glow, creating a stunning backdrop for your morning photograph.</p>



<p>Here are four reasons why a morning visit to the Colosseum is a must:</p>

</ul>



<p>Make the most of your visit to the Colosseum by embracing the freedom of a morning adventure.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Afternoon visits</h2>



<p>As the quiet of the morning fades, it&#039;s time to move into the bustling atmosphere of afternoon visits to the Colosseum.</p>



<p>The afternoon brings a different energy to this ancient wonder, with crowds of people from all over the world exploring its grandeur. But don&#039;t let that discourage you, because there are still ways to capture the beauty of the Colosseum and create unforgettable memories.</p>



<p>As the sun begins to descend, the afternoon light casts a warm glow on the stone walls, providing the perfect environment for your photographs. Take advantage of this golden hour and find the best places to take photos and show off the magnificence of the Colosseum.</p>



<p>And as the day comes to a close, soak in stunning sunset views from this iconic landmark, a truly magical experience that will leave you in awe of its timeless beauty.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Night visits</h2>



<p>For your nighttime visit to the Colosseum, be sure to arrive at the iconic monument before sunset to fully appreciate its stunning beauty. As the sun begins to set, the Colosseum transforms into a mesmerizing spectacle, radiating a warm glow against the darkening sky.</p>



<p>Here&#039;s why you should consider taking a night tour:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">

</ol>



<p>A nighttime visit to the Colosseum promises a truly unforgettable experience, where history and beauty merge under the starry sky.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Weekday visits vs weekend visits</h2>



<p>When planning your visit to the Colosseum, an important factor to consider is whether to go on a weekday or weekend.</p>



<p>Weekends tend to be busier, with crowds of visitors flocking to the iconic monument. However, if you choose to visit on a weekday, you may have a better chance of avoiding long lines and securing tickets for the time you want.</p>



<p>It&#039;s worth considering the pros and cons of each option to ensure the perfect time for your Colosseum experience.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Crowds on Peak Day</h3>



<p>To minimize wait time and avoid crowds at the Colosseum, consider visiting on a weekday instead of a weekend. Here are four reasons why a weekday visit is the best option:</p>

<p>Get your Colosseum tickets in advance to secure your spot for a midweek visit and avoid last-minute availability issues.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Climate considerations</h2>



<p>When planning your visit to the Colosseum, take into account the weather conditions during the period you choose. The Colosseum is one of Rome&#039;s most iconic tourist attractions, so make sure you have optimal weather to explore and capture stunning photos.</p>



<p>Rome enjoys a Mediterranean climate, with hot summers and mild winters. The best time to visit, weather-wise, is during spring (April to June) and fall (September to October). These seasons offer comfortable temperatures, typically ranging between 18 and 24 degrees Celsius (mid 60s to low 70s Fahrenheit).</p>



<p>The weather during these periods is ideal for spending long hours exploring the Colosseum and its surroundings, without the scorching heat or cold winds that can affect your visit. Remember to bring sunscreen, a hat, and comfortable clothing to fully enjoy your time at this magnificent historical site.</p>
